## Introduction

This page explains how to install and run Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, and Manjaro on a Raspberry Pi 4 (specifically, a Raspberry
Pi 400). Refer to the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) for more information
on the Raspberry Pi.


## Installing/Running Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, and Manjaro

1. Install [the Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). The Raspberry Pi
   Imager can install Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, and Manjaro onto a microSD card.
2. Follow the instructions on the imager to select an operating system and a microSD card.
3. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi, turn on the Pi, and follow the on-screen
   setup instructions.
4. You will now be able to run the selected OS on the Pi. Remember that, for Debian-based distros,
   `apt` is the package manager, while for Arch-based distros, `pacman` is the package manager.
