# Initial Setup

When you first start using a new machine, there are useful commands you can run and software to
install to get up to speed faster.

## General

[synth-shell](https://github.com/andresgongora/synth-shell) greatly improves the appearance of the
terminal. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS-QZKjAd-U) for more installation
information.

Remember to move the [.vimrc](.vimrc) file into the home (`~`) folder.

## Ubuntu

Run [ubuntu_setup.sh](ubuntu_setup.sh) when setting up an Ubuntu machine.

## Manjaro

Run [manjaro_setup.sh](manjaro_setup.sh) when setting up a Manjaro machine.
